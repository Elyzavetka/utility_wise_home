## Tech Stack:

- **JavaScript**: The primary language for both frontend and backend development.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language based on JavaScript that adds static typing, allowing me to define variable and function types to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **React**: Used to build the user interface. Components are implemented to display and interact with data.
- **Context API**: Used to manage global state and pass data between components without the need for prop drilling.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool and dev server, enabling fast builds and a smooth workflow for my web application.
- **GraphQL**: A query language that connects the React frontend with the Django backend, enabling efficient data requests and updates from the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database used to store user information and text content associated with photo posts, such as titles and descriptions.
- **dotenv**: A module used to manage environment variables, allowing me to hide API keys and other sensitive information from the codebase.
